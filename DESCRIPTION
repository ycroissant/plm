Description: A set of estimators for models and (robust) covariance matrices, and tests for panel data
             econometrics, including within/fixed effects, random effects, between, first-difference, 
             nested random effects as well as instrumental-variable (IV) and Hausman-Taylor-style models,
             panel generalized method of moments (GMM) and general FGLS models,
             mean groups (MG), demeaned MG, and common correlated effects (CCEMG) and pooled (CCEP) estimators
             with common factors, variable coefficients and limited dependent variables models.
             Test functions include model specification, serial correlation, cross-sectional dependence,
             panel unit root and panel Granger (non-)causality. Typical references are general econometrics
