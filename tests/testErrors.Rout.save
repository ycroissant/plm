Error in model.matrix.pFormula(object, data, model = "pooling") : 
  NA in the individual index variable
In addition: Warning message:
In pdata.frame(data, index) :
  at least one couple (id-time) has NA in at least one index dimension in resulting pdata.frame
 to find out which, use e.g. table(index(your_pdataframe), useNA = "ifany")
